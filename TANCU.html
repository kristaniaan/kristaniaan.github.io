<p>So, hi! I want to tell you about myself :) My school is in Bogor Highschool of Chemical Analyst. Yes. Of course. I'm a 16th years old teenager. My JHS was in Depok Public JHS number 3 and my ES was in Permata Bunda Catholic ES. Even though my ES was in Catholic school but my religion is Christian. My mom took me there so i can be a discipline personality. My SHS school is not like the other school.It's a school for an analyst wanna be and the study time is 4 years. My future goal is i wanna be a pharmacist, i want to analyze medicines so i go to this school. Beside that, i am the second child from 4 siblings. My dad works in the ship in PELNI company and my mom works as a housewife. Now my brother is in UGM university, my little brothe still in 9th grade and my little sister still in 5th grade. My first brother name is William Arthurius my little brother name is Fredly Andrian and the last my little sister name is Daniela Arleyne. I have a favorite idol since little and he is Christoffer Nelwan. Because i,m a dreamer i dream that he is my future soulmate. </p>
